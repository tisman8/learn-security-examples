- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is that if the call to the database fails, the exception returned will cause
the whole server to crash. In addition, the request from the user is not sanitized.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

In addition to the sanitization of the username and the addition of the try/catch block
to gracefully handle any exceptions, another security mechanism is adding some kind of
middleware to limit the number of requests per minute to prevent overloading.
