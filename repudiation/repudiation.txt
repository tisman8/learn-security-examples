- Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version is better at preventing repudiation than the insecure version.

The insecure version does not keep track of what user made what change when so that if there is an issue,
no one knows when that issue came up or if it was deployed or user introduced. A hacker can
make changes and no one will know or be able to trace it back to them.

- What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate to prevent such attacks?

A nightly/weekly job to check the logs for issues.
