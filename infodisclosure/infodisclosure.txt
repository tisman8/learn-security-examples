Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

The vulnerability is that hackers can access user information that is not intended
for them to access. This is because the insecure server does not check for string
usernames and ensure the incoming username is a valid request. We need to check this
BEFORE actually querying so that we don't get a false positive result and let the
hacker in.

Which CIA property does tampering violate?

Confidentiality -- the hacker can see passwords and other proprietary data
Integrity -- hackers can update and corrupt information in the request

What additional security mechanisms can you incorporate?

Ensure the incoming query (i.e. username) is a string and sanitize the username,
meaning remove any invalid (non-alphanumeric) characters. (implemented in secure.js)

Another possible security mechanism is to use two factor authentication.
